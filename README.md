# WPF Design Client App

## What is this?

I developed this Windows Presentation Foundation application as project in my C# programming course. It is made using Object-oriented design patterns. It is using C# and the .NET Framework. 

I created it to as a application to create client documents for an Interior designer, that they can print or save and then send to respective stakeholders (ie: contractors, painters, client-themselves, carpenters). Within this app you can add, delete, and edit client info. This includes email, address, and a floorplan photo.
